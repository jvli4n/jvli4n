# Hi I'm Julian!

I am currently in my Psychology Research Master at the University of Amsterdam specialising in psychological methods. I am passionate about everything that involves coding, statistics or data science.

## Projects

I have been helping with maintaining the [JASP](https://github.com/jasp-stats) codebase. As part of my internship, I created a [Bayesian Gauge R&R](https://github.com/jvli4n/jaspQualityControl/tree/creating-bayesian-gaugerR) quality control analysis.

### 📊 Data Science
During a course on Big Data Analytics, we participated in internal Kaggle competitions on three different topics that required machine learning:

1. [Movement classification](https://github.com/jvli4n/big-data-analysis/blob/main/Kaggle%20competitions/Physical%20activity%20classifier.ipynb)
2. [Text analysis](https://github.com/jvli4n/big-data-analysis/blob/main/Kaggle%20competitions/Offensive%20tweet%20detection.ipynb)
3. [Emotion recognition](https://github.com/jvli4n/big-data-analysis/blob/main/Kaggle%20competitions/Human%20faces.ipynb)

*Note: All competitions were group projects.*
